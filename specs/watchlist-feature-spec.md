# Watchlist Feature Specification

## Overview
Add a watchlist feature to tMovies that allows users to save their favorite movies and TV shows for later viewing. This feature will provide a personalized experience and help users organize their content discovery.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Features
1. **Add to Watchlist**
   - Users can add movies/TV shows to their watchlist from:
     - Movie/TV show detail pages
     - Search results
     - Category browsing pages
   - Visual indicator (heart/bookmark icon) to show add/remove state
   - One-click toggle functionality

2. **Remove from Watchlist**
   - Users can remove items from their watchlist
   - Confirmation dialog for accidental removals
   - Bulk remove option (select multiple items)

3. **View Watchlist**
   - Dedicated watchlist page accessible from main navigation
   - Display saved movies and TV shows in grid layout
   - Show basic info: poster, title, year, rating
   - Empty state when no items are saved

4. **Organize Watchlist**
   - Sort options: Date Added (newest/oldest), Title (A-Z), Rating (high/low)
   - Filter by type: All, Movies, TV Shows
   - Search within watchlist

#### User Experience
- Persistent storage across browser sessions
- Fast loading and responsive interactions
- Visual feedback for all actions
- Mobile-optimized interface

### Technical Requirements

#### Data Storage
- Client-side storage using localStorage
- Future-proof design for backend integration
- Data structure that supports movies and TV shows
- Error handling for storage limits/failures

#### Performance
- Lazy loading for large watchlists
- Optimistic UI updates
- Minimal impact on existing app performance

#### Browser Support
- Modern browsers with localStorage support
- Graceful degradation for unsupported browsers

## Design Approach

### User Interface Design

#### Watchlist Button/Icon
- **Location**: Movie cards, detail pages, search results
- **States**:
  - Default: Empty heart/bookmark outline
  - Added: Filled heart/bookmark with color
  - Hover: Scale animation and color change
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation

#### Watchlist Page Layout
```
Header: "My Watchlist" + Count + Sort/Filter controls
Content: Grid layout (responsive: 1-6 columns based on screen size)
Empty State: Illustration + "Start building your watchlist" message
```

#### Navigation Integration
- Add "Watchlist" link to main navigation
- Show count badge next to watchlist link
- Mobile: Include in hamburger menu

### Data Architecture

#### Storage Structure
```javascript
// localStorage key: 'tmovies_watchlist'
{
  movies: [
    {
      id: number,
      title: string,
      poster_path: string,
      release_date: string,
      vote_average: number,
      dateAdded: timestamp,
      type: 'movie'
    }
  ],
  tvShows: [
    {
      id: number,
      name: string,
      poster_path: string,
      first_air_date: string,
      vote_average: number,
      dateAdded: timestamp,
      type: 'tv'
    }
  ]
}
```

#### State Management
- Redux slice for watchlist state
- Actions: add, remove, load, clear
- Selectors: getWatchlist, isInWatchlist, getWatchlistCount
- Middleware for localStorage sync

### Component Architecture

#### New Components
1. **WatchlistButton** - Toggle button for add/remove
2. **WatchlistPage** - Main watchlist view
3. **WatchlistGrid** - Grid layout for watchlist items
4. **WatchlistFilters** - Sort and filter controls
5. **EmptyWatchlist** - Empty state component

#### Enhanced Components
- **MovieCard** - Add watchlist button
- **Header** - Add watchlist navigation link
- **Detail** pages - Add watchlist button

## Recommended Tech Stack

### Existing Technologies (Leverage Current Stack)
- **React 18** - Component framework
- **Redux Toolkit** - State management
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **React Router** - Navigation
- **React Icons** - Watchlist icons

### Additional Dependencies (Minimal Additions)
```json
{
  "react-hot-toast": "^2.4.1"  // For user notifications
}
```

### Storage Strategy
- **Phase 1**: localStorage (immediate implementation)
- **Phase 2**: Backend integration (future enhancement)
- **Abstraction**: Storage service layer for easy migration

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Week 1)
1. **Setup Redux slice** for watchlist state management
2. **Create WatchlistButton** component with basic add/remove
3. **Implement localStorage** service for data persistence
4. **Add buttons to existing pages** (detail, search results)
5. **Basic testing** and bug fixes

### Phase 2: Watchlist Page (Week 2)
1. **Create WatchlistPage** with grid layout
2. **Implement sort/filter** functionality
3. **Add navigation links** and routing
4. **Empty state** and loading states
5. **Mobile responsiveness**

### Phase 3: Polish & Enhancement (Week 3)
1. **Add animations** and micro-interactions
2. **Implement notifications** for user feedback
3. **Bulk operations** (select multiple, remove all)
4. **Performance optimization**
5. **Comprehensive testing**

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Redux slice actions and reducers
- localStorage service functions
- Component rendering and interactions

### Integration Tests
- Add/remove workflow
- Navigation between pages
- Data persistence across sessions

### User Testing
- Usability testing with real users
- Performance testing on various devices
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- Percentage of users who create a watchlist
- Average number of items in watchlists
- Watchlist page views and time spent

### Technical Performance
- Page load times remain under 2 seconds
- Watchlist operations complete under 200ms
- No memory leaks or storage issues

## Future Enhancements

### Short Term
- Export watchlist to external services
- Share watchlist with friends
- Watchlist recommendations

### Long Term
- User accounts and cloud sync
- Multiple watchlist categories
- Social features and discussions

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Storage limitations**: Implement data cleanup and limits
- **Performance impact**: Use pagination and virtualization
- **Browser compatibility**: Provide fallbacks and graceful degradation

### User Experience Risks
- **Accidental removal**: Add confirmation dialogs
- **Data loss**: Implement backup/restore functionality
- **Overwhelming interface**: Keep UI simple and intuitive
